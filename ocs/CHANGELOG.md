- multi_sig - work on ocs-module (2019-04-30):
    - removed 'C' from ocs.ReencryptReply
    - enable threshold > 1 for policies
    - change CA dependencies to have independent CAs for CreateOCS and Reencrypt policies
    - add AuthCreateOCS to ocs.CreateOCS call, which needs an ExtraExtension for the Policies
    - changed Policy to PolicyCreate, PolicyReencrypt, and PolicyReshare
    - correct use of PolicyReencrypt and PolicyReshare
